    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about our smart irrigation system",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is a smart irrigation system and how does it work?",
        "answer": "Our smart irrigation system uses advanced sensors, weather data, and AI algorithms to optimize watering schedules. The system monitors soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs in real-time, automatically adjusting watering to deliver the perfect amount of water exactly when your plants need it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much water can I save with this system?",
        "answer": "Most customers save 30-50% on their water usage. Our system eliminates overwatering by providing precise irrigation based on actual plant needs and environmental conditions. You'll see significant reductions in your water bill while maintaining a healthier landscape."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the system difficult to install?",
        "answer": "Our irrigation system is designed for easy DIY installation. Most homeowners complete setup in 2-3 hours with our step-by-step guide. For those who prefer professional installation, we offer certified installer services in most areas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I control the system remotely?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our mobile app allows you to control and monitor your irrigation system from anywhere. Adjust schedules, check soil moisture levels, receive alerts, and view watering history right from your smartphone."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens during rain or extreme weather?",
        "answer": "Our system automatically pauses watering when rain is detected or forecasted. It resumes normal operation once conditions improve, ensuring you never waste water irrigating during or right after rainfall."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will this system work for different types of plants?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Our system supports customizable zones for different plant types. You can create separate watering schedules for lawns, flower beds, vegetable gardens, and shrubs, each with optimized watering patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in the basic package?",
        "answer": "The starter kit includes: smart controller, 6 soil moisture sensors, weather sensor, WiFi hub, mobile app access, and all necessary installation components. Additional zones and sensors can be added as needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a warranty?",
        "answer": "We offer a 3-year comprehensive warranty on all components. Our customer support team is available 7 days a week to help with any questions or technical issues."

    "journeyTitle": "Our Journey of Innovation",
    "journeyP1": "The Smart Irrigation System represents a major technological advancement for **DIU Agro**, developed under the leadership of **Prof. Dr. M. A. Rahim** and guided by **Prof. Dr. M. R. Kabir**, Honorable Vice-Chancellor of **Daffodil International University (DIU)**. Successfully deployed at **Field Laboratory-1 (Malta Garden)**, the system integrates the Divoo Water Timer with a conventional sprinkler mechanism to create a real-time, moisture-dependent irrigation framework. It combines research, innovation, and student involvement to promote sustainable and data-driven agricultural practices.",
    "journeyP2": "In Bangladesh, agriculture consumes nearly **85–88% of national freshwater resources**, while traditional manual irrigation methods often lead to excessive water use and groundwater depletion. To address these challenges, the system uses multiple soil moisture sensors distributed across the field to continuously monitor real-time soil conditions. Operating through a dynamic threshold-based mechanism, irrigation automatically starts when moisture falls below a predefined lower limit and stops once the optimal upper threshold is reached. This closed-loop control ensures precise water application while preventing both waterlogging and moisture stress.",
    "journeyP3": "The system employs **SX1278 LoRa (433 MHz)** communication for reliable long-range data transmission, even through dense vegetation and rural structures. Sensor data are transmitted to a central server via a gateway and Wi-Fi network, where they are stored and analyzed using a web-based monitoring dashboard. Users can remotely observe soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, and control irrigation components through smartphones or computers. Additionally, solar power integration enhances sustainability by reducing grid dependency, achieving an average reduction of approximately 28% in water and energy consumption compared to conventional irrigation methods.",
