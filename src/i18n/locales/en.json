    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is a smart irrigation system and how does it work?",
        "answer": "Our smart irrigation system uses advanced sensors, weather data, and AI algorithms to optimize watering schedules. The system monitors soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs in real-time, automatically adjusting watering to deliver the perfect amount of water exactly when your plants need it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much water can I save with this system?",
        "answer": "Most customers save 30-50% on their water usage. Our system eliminates overwatering by providing precise irrigation based on actual plant needs and environmental conditions. You'll see significant reductions in your water bill while maintaining a healthier landscape."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the system difficult to install?",
        "answer": "Our irrigation system is designed for easy DIY installation. Most homeowners complete setup in 2-3 hours with our step-by-step guide. For those who prefer professional installation, we offer certified installer services in most areas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I control the system remotely?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our mobile app allows you to control and monitor your irrigation system from anywhere. Adjust schedules, check soil moisture levels, receive alerts, and view watering history right from your smartphone."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens during rain or extreme weather?",
        "answer": "Our system automatically pauses watering when rain is detected or forecasted. It resumes normal operation once conditions improve, ensuring you never waste water irrigating during or right after rainfall."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will this system work for different types of plants?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Our system supports customizable zones for different plant types. You can create separate watering schedules for lawns, flower beds, vegetable gardens, and shrubs, each with optimized watering patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in the basic package?",
        "answer": "The starter kit includes: smart controller, 6 soil moisture sensors, weather sensor, WiFi hub, mobile app access, and all necessary installation components. Additional zones and sensors can be added as needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a warranty?",
        "answer": "We offer a 3-year comprehensive warranty on all components. Our customer support team is available 7 days a week to help with any questions or technical issues."
